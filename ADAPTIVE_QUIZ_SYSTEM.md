# üéØ Adaptive Quiz System with Subjective Questions

## Overview
Implemented a fully adaptive quiz system that:
1. **Generates exercises with varying difficulty** (easy, medium, hard)
2. **Evaluates exercise performance** to determine optimal quiz difficulty
3. **Adapts quiz questions** based on student performance
4. **Includes subjective questions** for advanced students

---

## üîÑ How It Works

### 1. Exercise Generation (Varied Difficulty)

**Updated Prompt Structure:**
```json
{
  "exercises": [
    {"question": "Easy application question", "difficulty": "easy"},
    {"question": "Medium conceptual question", "difficulty": "medium"},
    {"question": "Hard analytical/synthesis question", "difficulty": "hard"}
  ]
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Students face **progressive difficulty** within each segment
- System can gauge understanding at different levels
- Better data for adaptive quiz generation

---

### 2. Exercise Evaluation & Performance Tracking

**Enhanced Evaluation System:**
```python
# LLM evaluates student answers and returns:
{
  "overall_performance": "excellent|good|fair|weak",
  "strengths": "brief strength summary",
  "areas_to_improve": "brief improvement areas",
  "difficulty_mastery": {
    "easy": true/false,
    "medium": true/false,
    "hard": true/false
  },
  "recommended_quiz_difficulty": "easy|medium|hard|mixed"
}
```

**Stored in Memory:**
- Performance tracked per segment
- Recommendations aggregated for topic quiz
- Used to determine quiz difficulty and question types

---

### 3. Adaptive Quiz Difficulty Decision

**Decision Logic:**

```python
# Check all exercise assessments for topic
exercise_recommendations = []
for segment in topic:
    assessment = get_exercise_assessment(segment)
    exercise_recommendations.append(
        (assessment.recommended_difficulty, assessment.performance)
    )

# Aggregate and decide
if most_performance == "excellent/good":
    quiz_difficulty = "hard"
    include_subjective = True  # Add subjective questions!
elif most_performance == "weak/fair":
    quiz_difficulty = "easy"
    include_subjective = False  # MCQ only
else:
    quiz_difficulty = "medium"
    include_subjective = True
```

**Fallback to Quiz History:**
- If no exercise data ‚Üí use previous quiz scores
- avg_score >= 85% ‚Üí hard + subjective
- avg_score <= 50% ‚Üí easy
- Otherwise ‚Üí medium

---

### 4. Subjective Questions

**When Included:**
- Student performed well in exercises (excellent/good)
- Student scored high in previous quizzes (>85%)
- Quiz difficulty is medium or hard

**Question Mix (5 questions total):**
- **3 MCQ questions** - test knowledge and comprehension
- **2 Subjective questions** - test analysis, synthesis, application

**Subjective Question Format:**
```json
{
  "type": "subjective",
  "question": "Explain how tokenization relates to text processing and provide an example from a real-world application.",
  "explanation": "Model answer: Tokenization breaks text into units (tokens)...",
  "hint": "Think about search engines or chatbots",
  "segment_hint": "tokenization"
}
```

**MCQ Format (unchanged):**
```json
{
  "type": "mcq",
  "question": "What is the main purpose of tokenization?",
  "options": ["A: ...", "B: ...", "C: ...", "D: ..."],
  "correct_answer": "A",
  "explanation": "...",
  "hint": "...",
  "segment_hint": "general"
}
```

## üí° Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Excellent Exercise Performance
```
Exercise Answers:
- Easy: ‚úÖ Correct understanding
- Medium: ‚úÖ Good conceptual grasp
- Hard: ‚úÖ Strong analytical ability

LLM Evaluation:
{
  "overall_performance": "excellent",
  "difficulty_mastery": {"easy": true, "medium": true, "hard": true},
  "recommended_quiz_difficulty": "hard"
}

Quiz Generated:
- Difficulty: HARD
- Questions: 3 MCQ (challenging) + 2 Subjective
- Subjective Example:
  "Analyze the trade-offs between different tokenization 
   strategies and propose which would be best for a 
   multilingual chatbot. Justify your answer."
```

---

### Scenario 2: Weak Exercise Performance
```
Exercise Answers:
- Easy: ‚úÖ Basic understanding
- Medium: ‚ùå Confused
- Hard: ‚ùå Struggling

LLM Evaluation:
{
  "overall_performance": "weak",
  "difficulty_mastery": {"easy": true, "medium": false, "hard": false},
  "recommended_quiz_difficulty": "easy"
}

Quiz Generated:
- Difficulty: EASY
- Questions: 5 MCQ (straightforward, concept-focused)
- No subjective questions (focus on fundamentals first)
```

---
